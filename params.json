The development started late 2003 and the first release of PL/Java arrived in January 2005. The project is released under the [[PLJava License]] license.\r\n\r\n##Features##\r\n* Ability to write both functions and triggers using Java 1.4 or higher.\r\n* Standardized utilities (modeled after the SQL 2003 proposal) to install and maintain Java code in the database.\r\n* Standardized mappings of parameters and result. Supports scalar and composite UDT's, pseudo types, arrays, and sets.\r\n* An embedded, high performance, JDBC driver utilizing the internal PostgreSQL SPI routines.\r\n* Metadata support for the JDBC driver. Both DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData are included.\r\n* Full support for PostgreSQL 8.0 savepoints and exception handling.\r\n* Ability to use IN, INOUT, and OUT parameters when used with PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher\r\n* Two language handlers, one TRUSTED (the default) and one that is not TRUSTED (language tag is javaU to conform with the defacto standard)\r\n* Transaction and Savepoint listeners enabling code execution when a transaction or savepoint is commited or rolled back.\r\n* Integration with GNU GCJ on selected platforms.\r\n\r\n##Documentation##\r\n[[Installation Guide]]  \r\n[[User Guide]]  \r\n[[Migration Guide]]  \r\n[[Contribution Guide]]  \r\n\r\n##Resources##\r\n[Downloads](http://pgfoundry.org/frs/?group_id=1000038)  \r\n[Mailing List](http://lists.pgfoundry.org/mailman/listinfo/pljava-dev)    \r\n[Bug Tracking](/tada/pljava/issues)  \r\n[Older bug tracker at PgFoundry](http://pgfoundry.org/tracker/?group_id=1000038)\r\n\r\n##Technology##\r\n[[Technoloy in Brief]]  \r\n[[The choice of JNI]]","note":"Don't delete this file!
