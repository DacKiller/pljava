    <h2>PLJava 1.0.0 released</h2>
    <h3>Bringing the power of Java<font face="Times New Roman">™</font> to PostgreSQL<font face="Times New Roman">™</font> 
    Functions and Triggers.</h3>
    <p>PLJava is an add on module to the PostgreSQL backend. It falls into the same 
    category as PL/SQL, PL/TCL, PL/Perl, and PL/Python. When installed, functions 
    and triggers can be written in Java using your favorite Java IDE and installed 
    into the database.</p>

<h3>This first <a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pljava/genpage.php?downloads">
release of PLJava</a> provides the following features.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ability to write both functions and triggers using Java 1.4 or higher.</li>
  <li>Standardized utilities (modeled after the SQL 2003 proposal) to install and 
  maintain Java code in the database.</li>
  <li>Standardized mappings of parameters and result. Complex types as well as sets 
  are supported.</li>
  <li>An embedded, high performance, JDBC driver utilizing the internal PostgreSQL 
  SPI routines.</li>
  <li>Full support for PostgreSQL 8.0 savepoints and exception handling.</li>
  <li>Integration with GNU GCJ on selected platforms.</li>
</ol>
<h3>PLJava in brief</h3>
<p>A function or trigger in SQL will appoint a static method in a Java class. In 
order for the function to execute, the appointed class must be installed in the 
database. PLJava adds a set of functions that helps installing and maintaining the 
java classes. Classes are stored in normal Java archives (AKA jars). A Jar may optionally 
contain a deployment descriptor that in turn contains SQL commands to be executed 
when the jar is deployed/undeployed. The functions are modeled after the standards 
proposed for SQL 2003.</p>
<p>PLJava implements a standardized way of passing parameters and return values. 
Complex types and sets are passed using the standard JDBC ResultSet class. Great 
care has been taken not to introduce any proprietary interfaces unless absolutely 
necessary so that Java code written using PLJava becomes as database agnostic as 
possible.</p>
<p>A new JDBC driver is included in PLJava. This driver is written directly on top 
of the PostgreSQL internal SPI routines. This driver is essential since it&#39;s very 
common for functions and triggers to reuse the database. When they do, they must 
use the same transactional boundaries that where used by the caller.</p>
<p>PLJava is optimized for performance. The Java virtual machine executes within 
the same process as the backend itself. This vouches for a very low call overhead. 
PLJava is designed with the objective to enable the power of Java to the database 
itself so that database intensive business logic can execute as close to the actual 
data as possible.</p>
<p>The standard Java Native Interface (JNI) is used when bridging calls from the 
backend into the Java VM and vice versa. Please read the

behind the choice of technology and
<a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pljava/genpage.php?solutions">a more 
in-depth discussion</a> about some implementation details. PLJava is primarily targeted 
to the new 8.0 version but will run with PostgreSQL 7.4 versions too albeit with 
some limitations. Read
